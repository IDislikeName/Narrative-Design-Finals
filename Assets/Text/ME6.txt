{i}While it’s absolutely not my job to teach him what he’s been doing all day to me is wrong, I don’t know if he’s gonna leave me alone after this.{/i}

#SAY.Flowchart.3.
{i}I need to convince him that what he did was CREEPY and WEIRD, but he’s way too caught up in his own fantasy!{/i}

#SAY.Flowchart.6.
{i}Sad to think that some people only understand the world in relation to themselves.{/i}

#SAY.Flowchart.14.
{i}Since this guy believes that the world revolves around him, I think he deserves to be humbled a little. {/i}

#SAY.Flowchart.7.
Charlie: “I’m not gonna stop! In fact, I’m gonna start from the very beginning of today!”

#SAY.Flowchart.23.
Charlie: “First! During chemistry, you straight up LIED to me about liking mornings.”

#SAY.Flowchart.24.
Guy: “N-No I didn’t!” (GUY CONFUSED)

#SAY.Flowchart.30.
Charlie: “For this entire semester so far, you’ve been consistently late to every chemistry class. The evidence is kind of against you here.”

#SAY.Flowchart.29.
Guy: “Woah...you’ve been noticing me for so long?” (GUY HAPPY)

#SAY.Flowchart.28.
Charlie: “That’s not my point!”

#SAY.Flowchart.27.
Charlie: “My point is that you lied about something to artificially create something we had in common!”

#SAY.Flowchart.26.
Guy: “A-Ack!” (GUY SHOCK)

#SAY.Flowchart.25.
Charlie: “That’s a terrible way to get closer to someone, you know!”

#SAY.Flowchart.31.
Charlie: “First! During chemistry, you said you didn’t like mornings but said some weird things about becoming a morning person...”

#SAY.Flowchart.32.
Guy: “Well, that’s because I wanted to show I was willing to get closer to you by committing to that!” (GUY CONFUSED)

#SAY.Flowchart.33.
Charlie: “By changing your perfectly fine lifestyle to artificially create something in common?”

#SAY.Flowchart.34.
Guy: “I was trying to say the right thing!” (GUY SAD)

#SAY.Flowchart.35.
Guy: “If you say the right thing to someone you like...they’ll like you more!”

#SAY.Flowchart.36.
Charlie: “You shouldn’t have to lie about yourself to get closer to or please someone.”

#SAY.Flowchart.37.
Charlie: “That’s a terrible way to get closer to someone, you know!”

#SAY.Flowchart.38.
Charlie: “Dumb AND bordering manipulative. Don’t build relationships off of lies.”

#SAY.Flowchart.48.
Charlie: “Then during the experiment, you asked some really weird questions too, like about my coffee order.”

#SAY.Flowchart.50.
Charlie: “You finished saying my order, word for word. I don’t remember telling you about my order, much less actually talking to you this whole semester.”

#SAY.Flowchart.51.
Guy: “Someone was talking about it before class, so I just listened in on their conversation...” (GUY NEUTRAL)

#SAY.Flowchart.49.
Charlie: “You eavesdropped and spied on other people to learn about me?”

#SAY.Flowchart.53.
Guy: “That’s how you learn about characters! You do your research!” 

#SAY.Flowchart.52.
Charlie: “I’m not some character you can research things about! It’s really creepy to me that you were gathering information like that!”

#SAY.Flowchart.56.
Charlie: “I don’t care how much you learned or how much you care...”

#SAY.Flowchart.55.
Charlie: “Your actions were intrusive for me AND the classmates that didn’t know you were listening in on them!”

#SAY.Flowchart.54.
Guy: “But...but I tried so hard! I put in the effort at least! Don’t I deserve something for that?” (GUY SAD)

#SAY.Flowchart.57.
Charlie: “Deserve?! How self-centered are you?”

#SAY.Flowchart.59.
Guy: “Huh?!” (GUY CONFUSED) (SFX Guy Huh?)

#SAY.Flowchart.58.
Charlie: “Nobody owes you anything in this world! I don’t automatically owe you for ‘trying hard’ regardless of how noble or messed up your actions are!”

#SAY.Flowchart.60.
Charlie: “Then during the experiment, you asked some really weird questions too, like about my coffee order.”

#SAY.Flowchart.61.
Charlie: “You wrote it down word for word. That was kind of strange to me since you’d never really said anything to me before.”

#SAY.Flowchart.62.
Guy: “It’s easier to remember character likes and dislikes if I write it down too...” (GUY NEUTRAL)

#SAY.Flowchart.63.
Charlie: “That’s the issue! I’m not some character you need to memorize weird details about.”

#SAY.Flowchart.64.
Guy: “Well, to get closer to someone, you have to remember what they like...right? If you do that, you can expect them to like you...” (GUY CONFUSED) (SFX Guy Huh?)

#SAY.Flowchart.65.
Charlie: “Remembering arbitrary things like that does not mean you automatically grow closer to someone!”

#SAY.Flowchart.66.
Charlie: “And you can’t expect someone to reward you for remembering that or ‘showing effort by writing it down’—I don’t owe you that. NOBODY owes you anything!”

#SAY.Flowchart.67.
Charlie: “Also, you wrote that all down during our experiment. That was annoying since we were supposed to writing down our lab observations.”

#SAY.Flowchart.74.
Charlie: “Our experiment failed because of you decided that making me uncomfortable was more important than class!”

#SAY.Flowchart.75.
Charlie: “If you actually cared about me like you claimed, you would’ve realized that doing the experiment was a priority of mine!”

#SAY.Flowchart.76.
Charlie: “Now I have to do it again during a club period. I’m missing a robotics meeting because you literally blew up my work in class.”

#SAY.Flowchart.77.
Guy: “I was trying to do it as fast as possible!” (GUY CONFIDENT)

#SAY.Flowchart.78.
Charlie: “Fast work isn’t good work. Plus, you weren’t actually trying, so don’t pretend like you were or for any other reason.”

#SAY.Flowchart.79.
Guy: “...” (SFX Guy Oh...)(GUY SAD)

#SAY.Flowchart.87.
Charlie: “And then we ran out of time for the experiment because making me uncomfortable was more important than class!”

#SAY.Flowchart.88.
Charlie: “If you actually cared about me like you claimed, you would’ve realized that doing the experiment was a priority of mine and ACTUALLY WORKED ON IT.”

#SAY.Flowchart.89.
Charlie: “Now I’m missing a robotics meeting to finish during club period because my partner assignment turned into a solo one!”

#SAY.Flowchart.90.
Guy: “I was just trying to get to know you...” (GUY SAD)

#SAY.Flowchart.91.
Charlie: “There is a time and place for everything. That lab time was not it, especially considering that experiment literally a third of our final grade in that class!”

#SAY.Flowchart.92.
Guy: “...” (SFX Guy Oh...) (GUY SAD)

#SAY.Flowchart.110.
Charlie: “And then you bought me a tuna sandwich.”

Charlie: “That’s just really creepy, dude. Don’t go through other people’s stuff—trash or not!”

#SAY.Flowchart.119.

#SAY.Flowchart.118.
Charlie: “No! I don’t want to accept anything from you!”

#SAY.Flowchart.117.

Charlie: “It doesn’t matter what YOU think!”

#SAY.Flowchart.134.
Charlie: “I didn’t want to accept it. I didn’t want it, period.”

#SAY.Flowchart.143.
Guy: “But it was sun-butter! I had it and it was actually pretty good? I am now extra supportive of peanut-butter alternatives.”(GUY HAPPY)

#SAY.Flowchart.142.
Guy: “Regardless...I should’ve gotten you something you could’ve actually eaten. Sorry about that.” (GUY SAD)
