#SAY.Flowchart.12.
{i}I go to the north entrance of the cafeteria and wait for a solid ten minutes. I don't mind the stares—the NPCs aren't important to me—but then I see a familiar face all the way in the back.{/I}(CHARLIE NEUTRAL)

#SAY.Flowchart.13.
Guy: “Oh, there she is. I’m pretty sure if she had calculus before lunch, she should’ve entered from here where I was waiting, but...oh well!”

#SAY.Flowchart.14.
{i}I make eye contact with Charlie. She looks back at me, then quickly averts her eyes. She must've felt shy, so maybe I should make the first move...{/i}(CHARLIE UNCOMFY)

{i}Charlie must’ve been so surprised that I remembered her name that she stood their in shock, which allowed me to take a seat at the same table. She sighed and took the seat across from me.{/i}

#SAY.Flowchart.28.
{i}We went around in circles for a couple of times. Was this hard mode or something? Anyway, Charlie eventually gave up and sat down, which allowed me to take a seat at the same table.{/i}(CHARLIE UNCOMFY, SFX Foosteps FAST)

#SAY.Flowchart.61.
Charlie: “Um. Ok. First, I went to the school cafe. The sandwiches there are better than the ones here. Second, sunbutter is a peanut butter alternative using sunflower seeds.”

#SAY.Flowchart.62.
